# Dynamic Array of Strings

This program demonstrates how to create an array of strings using dynamic memory allocation in C.

## Description

The program allows the user to input a number of strings and stores them in an array of strings (`char **ptr1`) using dynamic memory allocation. Each string is allocated space dynamically based on the maximum size defined (`MAX_SIZE_NAME`).

## Features

- Dynamically allocates memory for an array of strings.
- Accepts user input for multiple strings.
- Prints the strings entered by the user
